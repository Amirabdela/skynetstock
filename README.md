# Skynet Stock — Demo Inventory App

This Flutter app is a small, presentation-ready inventory/demo application built from the original SkyStock project and adapted for a classroom demo.

Highlights:
- Branded login screen with provided Skynet logo (use the image at `lib/screens/image-removebg-preview (2).png`).
- Dashboard-style landing with top navigation, action buttons, and account/messages/notifications icons.
- Add / edit / seed sample items and view transaction history.
- Simple Account and Settings screens for demonstration.

Run locally

1. Ensure Flutter is installed and on your PATH.
2. From the project root run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Notes for presentation
- Use "Continue as Demo" on the login screen to jump into the app quickly.
- The app uses local SQLite (sqflite) for storage. Seed sample data from the app bar menu to populate items.
- Replace the logo by overwriting `lib/screens/image-removebg-preview (2).png` (or update `pubspec.yaml` and code to a new path).

Next steps I can help with
- Create a short demo script / slides for your presentation.
- Add sample screenshots and assets.
- Polish animations and visual polish for slides.

Tell me which of these you'd like me to do next.
